# Tiny C Compiler
This is a compiler for the Tiny C programming language. Tiny C is a subset of the C programming language. Every legal Tiny C program is a legal C program and can be compiled using a traditional C compiler. 

This compiler is implemented in C++. 

This also contains some optimizations like local value numbering, copy propagation, dead code elimination, algebraic simplification, and constant folding. 

I am leaving the name out so current students don't "accidentally" find it.
